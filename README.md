Analysis and graphical visualizations of the results of testing ten different novel pharmaceuticals on the efficacy in treating squamous cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer

Three observable conclusions from the data:

•	The drug Capomulin showed the greatest reduction in tumor volume over days compared to placebo. These effects were observed after as little as 5 - 10 days and progressively shrank tumor volume over the 45 days tested. In follow up studies it may be interesting to look at longer timepoints (>45 days). 

•	The drug Capomulin significantly reduced the number of metastatic spreads of the cancer observed in reduced numbers of metastatic sites over 45 days compared to placebo. Notably, Infubinol also showed a modest yet significant reduction in metastatic sites.

•	Mice given Capomulin survived notably longer than those given placebo.
In summary, mice treated with Capomulin had smaller tumors, less spread of the cancer, and lived longer than placebo controls.  Capomulin looks promising as a potential anti-cancer drug to treat squamous cell carcinoma and additional follow up is recommended. 
   
Note: Ramicane may be an additional candidate for further testing with a similar anti-cancer profile to Capomulin.
